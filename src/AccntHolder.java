/**
 * Just like last time, the User class is responsible for retrieving
 * (i.e., getting), and updating (i.e., setting) user information.
 * This time, though, you'll need to add the ability to update user
 * information and display that information in a formatted manner.
 * 
 * Most of the functionality for this class should have already been
 * implemented last time. You can always reference my Github repository
 * for inspiration (https://github.com/rwilson-ucvts/java-sample-atm).
